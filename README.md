# Single Earth

## Introduction
This project is almost a copy of https://github.com/chriscourses/Intermediate-Three.js. Besides, I use the starter code from https://github.com/iamnotrodger/threejs_starter which uses webpack for dependency management. Thanks to [chriscourses](https://github.com/chriscourses) and [iamnotrodger](https://github.com/iamnotrodger).

I create this project to get familiar with the starter template above and try to know some basics about Three.js and WebGL.
